## Bayesian correlation and relevance networks

#### New methods for high-throughput sequencing data analysis using Bayesian statistics

This repo contains a set of R and Matlab scripts to accompany the following two related publications:

#### Publication 1

- [Bayesian Correlation Analysis for Sequence Count Data](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0163595), _PLoS ONE_, 2016

  The  code for this paper is in [BayesianCorrelation.R](/BayesianCorrelation.R)

  To use, simply 'source' the file, and then run whichever functions you like on the data. The first function allows you to specify your own condition-specific   priors, while the subsequent functions implement the three priors described in the paper.

#### Publication 2

- [Uncovering robust patterns of microRNA co-expression across cancers using Bayesian Relevance Networks](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0183103), _PLoS ONE_, 2017
